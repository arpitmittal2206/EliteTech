📌 EliteTech Java Developer Internship Projects
This repository contains the complete project work done during my virtual internship at EliteTech. The internship focused on core Java development and covered real-world programming challenges involving:

✅ File Handling Utility: Read, write, and update files using Java I/O.

✅ REST API Client: Connect and consume public APIs using HttpURLConnection.

✅ Multithreaded Chat Application: Build a real-time console-based chat system with server-client architecture.

✅ AI-Based Recommendation System: Simple Java-based recommendation engine using content-based filtering.

📁 All tasks are structured, commented, and ready to run.
💡 This internship helped sharpen my Java skills through hands-on problem solving and real-world project implementation.
